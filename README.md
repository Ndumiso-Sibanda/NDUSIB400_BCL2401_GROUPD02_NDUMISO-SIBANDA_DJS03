Book List Project
Overview
This project is a simple web application that displays a list of books. Users can view more books by clicking a "Show More" button, navigate back to previous pages using a "Back" button, and search for books using a search form.

Improvements
Pagination and Navigation:

Implemented a "Show More" button to load more books without refreshing the page.
Added a "Back" button to navigate to the previous page of books.
Search Functionality:

Added a search form that filters books based on the title and author.
Displayed search results dynamically without refreshing the page.
Enhanced User Experience:

Ensured the search overlay focuses on the input field when opened.
Disabled the "Show More" button when there are no more books to display.
What I Learned
Event Handling:

Handling form submissions and button clicks using event listeners.
Preventing default form submission behavior to handle data dynamically.
DOM Manipulation:

Creating and appending elements to the DOM using JavaScript.
Updating the inner HTML of elements to reflect changes in data.
Filtering and Pagination:

Filtering an array of objects based on user input.
Implementing pagination to display a subset of data at a time.
User Interface Enhancements:

Improving the user experience by focusing on input fields and updating button states.

User Experience Enhancements
Ensured that when the search overlay is opened, the input field is focused for a better user experience.
Disabled the "Show More" button when there are no more books to display, providing clear feedback to the user.
Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in handling user interactions, managing state, and dynamically updating the DOM. By implementing pagination, search functionality, and navigation, the application became more user-friendly and efficient. These improvements enhanced the overall functionality and usability of the book list application, making it a practical and enjoyable tool for users.
